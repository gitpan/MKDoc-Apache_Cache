MKDoc::Apache_Cache - Speedup Apache::Registry scripts 
======================================================

MKDoc::Apache_Cache is a drop in replacement for Apache::Registry. It is very
configurable so that you can define precisely what you want to cache, under
which circumstances and for how long.

MKDoc::Apache_Cache is an ideal solution if you have an Apache::Registry script
which produces near-static pages and has a few annoying bottlenecks which could
do with some caching.
